# Course Assignment Information

This is a JavaScript Server Course Assignment I got at the beginning of my second semester at my Backend development degree. The task was to finish a code that was about 25% complete, and not all the functionality had been done. The task was to fix the errors, see what has been done and complete what still needs to be done.

The *Initial Commit* is the original code I got for the assignment.

The *Final Commit* is my finished code that I sent in for the assignment.
